[Piping Server](https://github.com/nwtgck/piping-server) written in Rust

## Purpose
**Faster Piping Server than ever**  

* Faster is better
* Low memory cost
* Machine-friendly implementation

## Why Rust?
Safe, Fast and No garbage collection (GC)

## Run a server
You can choose some ways to run a server.

### Way 1: Binary

Executable files are available on [GitHub Release](https://github.com/nwtgck/piping-server-rust/releases) for Linux and macOS. You can download it and run it. Alternatively you can use a package for your distribution as mentioned in the badge in the head of the README.

The executable file for Linux is portable because it is statically linked.

### Way 2: Docker
Run a Piping Server on <http://localhost:8181> by the following command.

```rs
docker run -p 8181:8080 --init nwtgck/piping-server-rust
```

### Way 3: Cargo
You can clone, build and run this project as follows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nwtgck/piping-server-rust.git
cd piping-server-rust
cargo run --release
```
